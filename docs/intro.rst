Introduction
============

The EU-funded DComEX project plans to develop numerical methods
enhanced by artificial intelligence as well as a scalable software
framework that enables exascale computing. A key innovation of DComEX
is the development of AI-Solve, a novel scalable library of
AI-enhanced algorithms for solving large-scale sparse linear systems,
which are fundamental to computational mechanics. Researchers will
fuse physics-constrained machine learning with efficient
block-iterative methods and incorporate experimental data at multiple
levels of fidelity to quantify model uncertainties. Efficient
deployment of these methods in exascale supercomputers will offer
scientists and engineers unprecedented capabilities for conducting
predictive simulations of mechanical systems in applications ranging
from bioengineering to manufacturing.
